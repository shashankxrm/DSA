// LC 543 : https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
// The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
// This path may or may not pass through the root.
// The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
